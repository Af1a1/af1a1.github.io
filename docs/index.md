# Welcome to Visual Quiz Builder

This app is built to help you connect with your customers in an engaging way to help them find the right products and build loyalty to your brand.

The quiz setup is split into two phases - quiz building and quiz settings. Start by creating your quiz’s questions and answers. Then link products to the different quiz pathways. Next, you can style your quiz to match your unique store’s look and feel using different background colors, fonts, and imagery.

## How it works
With the easy-to-use quiz builder, add questions and options to your quiz. Make as many edits as you like, and preview your quiz, before you publish it to your audience. Edit the look and feel of the quiz by changing colors, fonts, or adding images. You can create a quiz that recommends products, collections, or variants (SKUs) to give you ultimate control over the recommendation. When you’re ready to make your quiz live, simply publish it and use your custom link to make your quiz appear wherever you want!
